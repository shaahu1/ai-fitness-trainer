                <p>
                    In our research, we are trying to detect multiple human body types Apple, Inverted Triangle, Pear, Rectangle of
                    Sri
                    Lankan male using regular smartphone camera images with 2D images and use detected body type as a reference to
                    suggest
                    proper exercises for improving their physical appearance. VGG 16 machine learning model technology that we are
                    hoping to
                    use for this project. <br />
                    With busy lifestyles and bad patterns of food usage the lack of exercise causes much trouble to humanity. The
                    worst
                    thing is people tend to do exercises by themselves and get into much more trouble or just waste their time
                    without
                    any
                    guide to have proper exercise guide or what exercises to do to maximize their health and fitness goals. ICT can
                    be
                    used
                    to make people much more aligned with fitness.

        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>
            Our main objective is to develop a mobile application to identify human body types based on machine learning, using our
            own collected dataset of 2D regular images of Sri Lankan males.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specific Objective, <br/> <br/>
            ● To identify which human body parts are the most suitable for detecting the overall body type of humans using medical
            science. <br/> 
            ● To identify which machine learning algorithms are the most suitable for detecting human body types. <br/>
            ● To develop an android app which assists people with guidance for the exercises and suggest meal plans according to
            their body type.

        <h1>Works</h1>
        <h2> Data Set </h2>
        <p>
            The dataset plays a significant role in the performance of any machine learning-based system. For that project, we need
            to collect human body images for the dataset. Due to ethical and social concerns, we decided to collect and build our
            own dataset by manually taking images and browsing images through the internet. The pose of the human body is much more
            critical to detect the overall body type hence data collection process became slower, We advised volunteers to make a
            T-pose or stand straight spine erect and hand beside the body and further from their body. Finally, we collected 530
            male body images in Sri Lankan and Asian regions.
        </p>

        <h2> ML Model  </h2>
        <p>
            We tried to train a model with CNN and train 2 pre-trained models ResNet50 and VGG16. In terms of accuracy, we chose the
            VGG16 model to train our model. Finally, we got the model with 82% accuracy and for that, we use data augmentation
            techniques. All model training is done by google collabs.
            <br/> <br/>
            <b>Used tools :</b> VGG16 and Google Collab
        </p>

        <h2> Mobile Application Development </h2>
        <p>
            We selected the android platform as the base Operating system for which our application is to be installed and we have
            used Figma online web application to catch the User Interfaces of the application. We used the android studio as the IDE
            and the language is java. To store the user, exercises, and meal plan data we use firebase real-time database. The ML
            Model was stored locally in the application.
